## General Info

- The Photoshop template is located in the "Working Files" folder.
- You can create your own documents or lay the grid over an existing document using the Photoshop actions within the "Actions" folder.
- All grid based values are based off of artwork from Apple in the "Research" folder.

## iOS 7 OCD App Icon Template

- Most iOS app icon templates start out with designing at 1024×1024 and use a **single smart object** that is then scaled to every size needed. With this approach, it’s quite difficult to gain context for each size. More importantly, there’s no way to tweak the app icons for various devices.
- The iOS 7 OCD app icon template is different than others in the fact that each app icon is its own **independent smart object**. This allows you to design your app icons at the exact sizes that they'll be used. Another huge difference in our template is that **the grid is uniquely crafted for each app icon**. Thus, yielding pixel perfect values at every size.
- Since our template uses independent smart objects we recommend starting with your **flagship app icon (iPhone or iPad)** and working out from there. You’ll notice there are only shapes for circular grid elements but vertical and horizontal grid lines are present as **Photoshop guides** within each smart object. This is because shapes as guides are not ideal in pixel based programs.

## Example Workflow

- If you’re designing an iPhone app icon, start with AppIcon60x60@2x.
- Once you’ve completed your design, [save and close the smart object](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/photoshop/cs/using/WS41A5B796-6846-4e95-8459-95243441E126.html#WS44303F25-1238-4096-A39D-368AAFBBFC3Da).
- [Duplicate the smart object](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/photoshop/cs/using/WS41A5B796-6846-4e95-8459-95243441E126.html#WSB0431CBD-5A81-456a-8D49-6BE68D0BB521a), rename it to your next desired app icon
- Open the smart object and [resize it as needed](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/photoshop/cs/using/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-7945a.html#WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-7939a).
- Delete and replace the grid folder each time you resize the document.*
- Notice that your design needs to be slightly tweaked each time you resize it.
- Use the size specific grids to help you make each app icon pixel perfect for every use.
- Use the [vector masks](http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/masking-layers-vector-masks.html) throughout the template to apply the iOS 7 rounded corners to your designs.
- These masks can be useful for previewing or exporting your app icons.
- You can export your icons using the existing [slices](http://helpx.adobe.com/en/photoshop/using/slicing-web-pages.html), or by turning on Photoshop's [image asset generator](http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/generate-assets-layers.html) in the file menu.

* Replacing the grid is extremely easy if you use the ios-7_ocd-app-icon-template_grid [Photoshop actions](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/photoshop/cs/using/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-7451a.html) included with the template.
